# Iris Flowers Predictor
The Iris Flowers Predictor is a machine learning application that predicts the type of iris flower based on input features: `Sepal Length`, `Sepal Width`, `Petal Length`, and `Petal Width`. The model is built using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and trained on the Iris dataset. The app is developed in Python using Streamlit and scikit-learn and deployed on Cloud Run (GCP).
